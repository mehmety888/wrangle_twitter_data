    "In this project data is gathered from 3 different sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- From flat file using Pandas' read_csv method as `twitter_archive_df`\n",
    "- Downloading flat file (.tsv) from Internet using request library and using read_csv method with sep ='\\t' option as `image_predictions_df`\n",
    "- Data is gathered via the Twitter API: Firstly, developer account is obtained. Then, various keys are generated to get api object. Using get_status method, the data is gathered for each tweet in twitter_archive_df as a line and saved as a text file.Then line by line these tweets are read as JSON format,and queried for tweet_id, retweet count and favorite count,finally gathering as a dataframe: `retweet_favorite_df`"
